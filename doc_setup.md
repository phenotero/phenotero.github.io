Phenotero requires a running installation of Zotero and the associated Microsoft Office Word or LibreOffice Writer plugin. 

These plugins are bundled with Zotero from Version 4.0 upwards and add a Zotero toolbar to Word or Writer. Zotero runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems and the installation is easy and quick. Please obtain Zotero from [www.zotero.org](http://www.zotero.org).
