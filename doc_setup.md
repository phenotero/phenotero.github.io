How to set up Phenotero 		

The initial set-up of Phenotero requires three steps: 
 * Installation of Zotero
 * Phenotero library import
 * Citation Style Language (CSL) file import


# Installation 

Phenotero requires a running installation of Zotero. Zotero runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems and the installation is easy and quick. Please obtain Zotero from [www.zotero.org](http://www.zotero.org) and follow the instructions for your operating system.

After completing the installation, Zotero should look like this on Mac (and very similar on other operating systems):

You will also need the associated plugin for your word processing software. These plugins are bundled with Zotero from Version 4.0 upwards and automatically add a Zotero toolbar to Word or Writer. Your Word/Writer should show this:

In Google Docs, Zotero should also be already incorporated and available to be used automatically given your Zotero desktop version is running.
