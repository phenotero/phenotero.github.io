title: Phenotero: now also in Google Docs!

---

Thanks to the awesome developers at Zotero, Phenotero is now running in Google Docs as well. In our tests, we basically only had to open Google Docs and already had everything set up. See [this post from Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/blog/google-docs-integration/) for more information how the integration works. Have fun.
