title: Phenotero being used

---

Phenotero has been cited twice now. Especially the paper by Zafer YÃ¼ksel is worth mentioning. Not only did they use Phenotero to refer to HPO classes in the publication, but also they write "We also would like to encourage researchers using Phenotero which facilitates standardized phenotypic data collection at the time of describing the patient that allows efficient data entry in the literature". See [the paper here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ajmg.a.61210).
