title: About Phenotero
subtitle: What is Phenotero ?
---


Phenotero is a simple tool for referencing phenotypes and diseases in written text and allows clinicians and clinical researchers to stay within word processing software. This enables a novel workflow for direct in-text annotations of ontology classes (such as HPO terms), which we call _annotate as you write_.

# Zotero

Phenotero is based on the awesome, free, and open-source citation software Zotero and thus builds on existing features such as a word-processor plugin, standardised and extendible citation styles, a search functionality, and active community support.

# Why Phenotero ?

Phenotero provides a quick and easy solution for referencing ontology-based phenotypes and diseases by direct in-text annotations of classes of ontologies such as the HPO or MONDO. It is an extension of the Zotero citation management open source software, which runs on all common operating systems and is easily integrated into multiple word processors, including LibreOffice, Microsoft Word and Google Docs. Users are presented with a minimal amount of computational complexity and can readily stay within their usual working environment.
