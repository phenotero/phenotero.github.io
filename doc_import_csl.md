subtitle: How to enable Phenotero citation styles
---

In order to obtain the citation styles, go [to this site](/data_csl/) and download them. Afterwards, you have to open Zotero and go the Settings menu. From there, you select "Cite" and get a list of all currently imported citation styles. 

This should look like this:

You can then add the Phenotero styles by clicking on the Button labelled with a "+" and then selecting the csl-file you just downloaded. You have to repeat the last step separately for each of the styles you wish to import.
