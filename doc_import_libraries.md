There are two methods for importing the Phenotero library. 

1. The simplest way to ensure up-to-date library access is to join our Phenotero groups: When you are logged in with your Zotero account on the Zotero website, join the Phenotero groups called [phenotypes](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2168222/phenotypes) and [diseases](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2168493/diseases). More information is [available here](/data_groups/). The next time you open your Zotero application (and are logged in with you Zotero account), Zotero will start syncing these libraries under “Group Libraries”. This syncing process will take about 20 minutes for the “phenotypes” and about 40 minutes for the “disease” library.

2. You can obtain JSON files for the phenotypes and diseases libraries from XXX. After you have downloaded these files, you can select “File”, “Import”, and then select one of the downloaded files. This will add the libraries to your local library.
